## 📝 Problem Description

Given numbers on a circle, find the maximum number of neighbouring pairs with an even sum.

You are given N numbers on a circle, described by an array A. Find the maximum number of neighbouring pairs whose sums are even. One element can belong to only one pair.

Write a function that, given an array A consisting of N integers, returns the maximum number of neighbouring pairs whose sums are even.

Examples:

1. Given A = [4, 2, 5, 8, 7, 3, 7], the function should return 2. We can create two pairs with even sums: (A[0], A[1]) and (A[4], A[5]). Another way to choose two pairs is: (A[0], A[1]) and (A[5], A[6]).

2. Given A = [14, 21, 16, 35, 22], the function should return 1. There is only one qualifying pair: (A[0], A[4]).

3. Given A = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], the function should return 3. We can create three pairs: (A[0], A[5]), (A[1], A[2]) and (A[3], A[4]).


Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

- N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
- each element of array A is an integer within the range [0..1,000,000,000].
