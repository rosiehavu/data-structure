## 📝 Problem Description

You are given an array A consisting of N integers within the range [1...N]. In one move, you can increase or decrease the value of any element by 1. After each move, all numbers should remain within the range 
[1...N].

Your task is to find the smallest required number of moves to make all elements in the array pairwise distinct (in other words, no value can appear in the array more than once).

Write a function:
- N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
- Each element of array A is an integer within the range [0..1,000,000,000].
