# Data Structure
Welcome to Rosie's grinding space. This repo serves as my learning journey to ace DSA questions and pass the technical interview. 

Some questions are solved before I learn data structure, so sometimes the solutions look quite long at first. Please stay tuned as I'm gaining my knowledge and improving the codes day by day :)
